## Inspiration
> We've all spent a great deal of time in Discord; because of this, a lot of people have realized that sarcasm and a lot of opinions don't really translate well to text-based applications. To help alleviate this problem, we created Cutie Sentimental. Yeah, the name could use some work.

## What it does
> Cutie Sentimental is capable of executing multiple commands from the space of a Discord channel. We actively track sentimentality across all messages sent during the bot's uptime. We can use the data to provide server members with all that data, or better, visualize it using graphs. As a fun bonus feature, we also implement facial recognition software which can detect if a person is smiling in an uploaded photo. All you have to do to learn how to use the bot is invite it to the server, and enter '>help'.

## How we built it
> Our bot was created in Python, and thus, has access to many advanced packages with varied capabilities. As such, we used OpenAI's natural language processing algorithm to track sentiment for both certain phrases and over the general lifetime of the Discord server. Also, we decided to implement graphical visualizations for these features using more integrations. For our smile detection software, we used another API, OpenCV. 

## Challenges we ran into
> Few developments go without issues. But most of our struggles were actually spent planning the bot; understanding how the algorithms work and how to design more implementations for them was something that took a great deal of effort. Moreover, we wanted to design a website to showcase and demo the bot, and this also added a great strain on our development.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
> All in all, we're proud of our success in successfully integrating some pretty advanced OpenAI software into a medium that is commonly used by the average Discord user. 

## What we learned
> After creating a bot, we've realized we have severely underestimated the amount of polish and quality that a lot of developers have put into their products. If we were the remake the bot, we'd add more polish and more user-friendly features like adding better visuals and feature descriptions.

## What's next for Cutie Sentimental
> Who knows? For sure, we're going to keep competing in Hackathons, and ensure that our projects will only get better with each one!
